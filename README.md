Truly Unique App


Once logged in the user will be shown a list of options they can choose from. Kind: Poem or Quote && Mood: Love, Encouragement or Funny

May still need to still create login controller on the backend or can just confirm from backend that the email exist.

Affirmation component should ask for the mood and kind of poem and store it in state.

Then use a find over the affirmation array to show a letter with those criteria. Once found save that letter id and the user id to history.

Once the person signs back in save history array to its own state and show last if requested or show new which is affirmation array !== history array.
