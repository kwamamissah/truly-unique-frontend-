Top section with title and 'Get Started Button'
Middle section for today's Date

When 'Get Started Button is clicked' -> Truly Unique graphic appears with a signup/login option underneath.

If a user clicks sign up they will be asked for their name and email address.

If a user clicks login they will just be asked for their unique email address.

Once logged in the user will be shown a list of options they can choose from. Kind: Poem or Quote && Mood: Love, Encouragement or Funny

May still need to still create login controller on the backend or can just confirm from backend that the email exist.
